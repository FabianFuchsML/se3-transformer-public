***Check out [this work](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-se3-transformers-training-using-an-nvidia-open-source-model-implementation/) by Alexandre Milesi et al. from Nvidia. They managed to speed up training of the SE(3)-Transformer by up to 21(!) times and reduced memory consumption by up to 43 times. Code [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/DGLPyTorch/DrugDiscovery/SE3Transformer).***

## Prerequisites

*update 2020/12/22: we made some updates to support dgl >= dgl0.5.0; it is tested with the combinations dgl0.5.3 & torch 1.7 and dgl0.4.3.post2 & torch 1.4*
***We recommend using dgl 0.5.3 & torch 1.7***

- Install this repo in your virtual environment as `pip install -e .`
(this is important for easier importing from parent folders)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/)
  - pip install dgl-cu110
  - <del> dgl 0.4.3 heads-up : this part is a bit tricky to make work correctly; for us `pip install dgl-cu90==0.4.3.post2` worked; if you use a different version, you might need to do some debugging (I believe expected datatypes for some interfaces changed)
	- to check which CUDA version pytorch is using: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"`
	- check [here](https://docs.dgl.ai/install/index.html) for compatibility of DGL with CUDA etc.
    - e.g. for CUDA 9.0: `pip install dgl-cu90==0.4.3.post2`
    - e.g. for CUDA 10.1: `pip install dgl-cu101==0.4.3.post2`
    - e.g. for CUDA 10.2: `pip install dgl-cu102==0.4.3.post2`</del>
  - <del> if you get the error “libcublas.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory”, running this command might help: `pip install torch-cluster==latest+cu101 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.4.0.html`  </del>
  - please help us making this part more robust: tell us what you did to make it work on your specific system and we'll put it here
- `pip install packaging`
- optional: [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/)
  - install with `pip install wandb`
- optional: install the lie learn library via: `pip install git+https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/lie_learn`
- optional: for testing speed of different parts of the code, we used https://github.com/pyutils/line_profiler

Check `requirements.txt` for other dependencies


## Experiments

The code for experiments specific is meant to be placed in the folder [experiments](https://github.com/FabianFuchsML/se3-transformer-public/tree/master/experiments).

We provide an implementation for the n-body experiment, the QM9 experiments. In addition, we provide a multi-step toy-optimisation experiment losely inspired the by protein structure prediction task.


## Basic usage
The SE(3)-transformer is built on top of the [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) in 
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). 

```python
###
# Define a toy model: more complex models in experiments/qm9/models.py
###

# The maximum feature type is harmonic degree 3
num_degrees = 4

# The Fiber() object is a representation of the structure of the activations.
# Its first argument is the number of degrees (0-based), so num_degrees=4 leads
# to feature types 0,1,2,3. The second argument is the number of channels (aka
# multiplicities) for each degree. It is possible to have a varying number of
# channels/multiplicities per feature type and to use arbitrary feature types, 
# for this functionality check out fibers.py.

fiber_in = Fiber(1, num_features)
fiber_mid = Fiber(num_degrees, 32)
fiber_out = Fiber(1, 128)

# We build a module from:
# 1) a multihead attention block
# 2) a nonlinearity
# 3) a TFN layer (no attention)
# 4) graph max pooling
# 5) a fully connected layer -> 1 output

model = nn.ModuleList([GSE3Res(fiber_in, fiber_mid),
                       GNormSE3(fiber_mid),
                       GConvSE3(fiber_mid, fiber_out, self_interaction=True),
                       GMaxPooling()])
fc_layer = nn.Linear(128, 1)

###
# Run model: complete train script in experiments/qm9/run.py
###

# Before each forward pass we make a call to get_basis_and_r, which computes
# the equivariant weight basis and relative positions of all the nodes in the
# graph. Pass these variables as keyword arguments to SE(3)-transformer layers.

basis, r = get_basis_and_r(G, num_degrees-1)

# Run SE(3)-transformer layers: the activations are passed around as a dict,
# the key given as the feature type (an integer in string form) and the value
# represented as a Pytorch tensor in the DGL node feature representation.

features = {'0': G.ndata['my_features']}
for layer in model:
    features = layer(features, G=G, r=r, basis=basis)

# Run non-DGL layers: we can do this because GMaxPooling has converted features
# from the DGL node feature representation to the standard Pytorch tensor rep.
output = fc_layer(features)

```


## FAQ

**Type issues with QM9 experiments**

One user reported that they experienced issues with data types when running the QM9 experiments. For them, adding the following lines just before line 184 of qm9.py fixed the issue:
```
x=x.astype(np.float32)
one_hot=one_hot.astype(np.float32)
atomic_numbers=atomic_numbers.astype(np.float32)
```


**Speed**

- Constructing equivariant layers is indeed computationally expensive, one of the bottlenecks being the computation of the spherical harmonics.

- We did put significant effort into speeding up the computation of spherical harmonics, in part by parallelising the computation on the GPU (the paper goes into more depth about what we did). A key challenge here is that they depend on the relative distances and hence are different for each point cloud / graph.

- Further speeding up SE3-Transformer type approaches (approaches working with irreducible representations, that is) and potentially making them more memory efficient would certainly be a big step forward. If I think about why translation-equivariance is part of so many current network architectures (whether the task actually has translational symmetry or not) and other symmetries are not, the reason is most likely computational efficiency. So, if anyone is interested in researching this direction, we can only encourage them.

*Here are some ideas about speeding up the SE3-Transformer:*

- Depending on the dataset and your system requirements, it might be possible to cache the spherical harmonics / basis vectors. This could tremendously speed things up as it basically addresses all the bottlenecks at once.

- A not-so-puristic alternative/version of the above is voxelising the input. This destroys exact equivariance but makes it much easier to cache the spherical harmonics as it reduces the number of overall evaluations.

- Lower hanging fruit: check what part of the network you can make slimmer for a specific task. E.g., the number of degrees makes a big difference in speed & memory and the effect on performance saturates.
